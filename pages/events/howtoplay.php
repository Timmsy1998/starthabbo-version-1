<h3>StartHabbo prides itself in fun and exciting events. Here are some of the more standard games, and how to play them:<br></h3>
<br>
<p><b>Heaven or Hell:</b> When the game starts, the host will drop a banzai tile in the game area. Players then walk onto the banzai tile and will get teleported to either Heaven or Hell. Heaven keeps the player safe, and Hell returns the player outside of the game area. The last player to remain in Heaven wins.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Telephrase:</b> When the game starts, players will be sitting down. The host will then say a topic, such as color. Players then guess a keyword for that topic, such as red. If players guess the keyword correct, they will port to a safe area. The last person to guess the keyword right or still sitting in the main area is out. The last player in the safe area wins.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Bank Game:</b> When the game starts, players will be sitting down. The host will drop a dice next to each player in order. Players then roll the dice. Each of the numbers on the dice do something specific, which the host will indicate when playing. The last player still in the game wins the amount of coins that are in front of them at the end.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Fridge/Balloon Game:</b> When the game starts, players will be sitting down. The host will ask each player in order to go to the fridge or balloon stand. Players then use the fridge or balloon stand to pick an item. Each item does something specific, which the host will indicate when playing. The last player still in the game wins.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Falling Furni:</b> When the game starts, the host will drop random furni in the game area that players can stand or sit on. When dropped the players then rush onto the random furni, the last person to stand/sit on the furni is out. Depending on the host, there may be special actions for the last remaining 4, 3, or 2 players. The last player in the game wins.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Cozzie Change:</b> When the game starts, players will be sitting down. The host will say a topic, such as superheroes. Players then dress up as that topic, such as Superman. Once done changing, players must stand up, and can not double change, unless approved by the host. Once all the players are standing, the host will choose their favorite looks to sit. Depending on the host, there may be a vote between the last 2 standing. The last player in the game wins.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Danger Pod/Tiles:</b> When the game starts, the host will pick danger chairs (usually color pods) or tiles. The host will drop a banzai tile in the game area. Players then walk onto the banzai tile and will get teleported to one of the many chairs or tiles. If a player lands on the chosen danger chair or tile, they are teleported out of the game. The last player in the game wins. </p>
