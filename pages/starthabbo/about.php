				<p><b style="color: #7FB583;">StartHabbo</b> is an un-official Habbo Hotel fansite. Created at the start of 2012, by a nice fellow, Daniel Guest. Unfortunately Daniel had closed StartHabbo's doors due to unforeseen circumstances. Mid 2016 came around and two management members from 2012 united with a new face to open the doors once more. StartHabbo is currently owned by <a target="_blank" href="http://habbo.com/profile/BookOfJack" style="color: #7FB583">BookOfJack</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://habbo.com/profile/xo_Fatzo" style="color: #7FB583">xo_Fatzo</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://habbo.com/profile/xo_Hannah" style="color: #7FB583">xo_Hannah</a>.</p>

				With Version One, we decided to try and go with a different colour scheme other than blue, as most fansites use the colour blue now, we wanted to go with something different, so we have introduced the new look of StartHabbo... Green & Dark Grey. So what features are now in version one you ask?
